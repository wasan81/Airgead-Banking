# Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements
1. Airgead Banking wants a screen to display with the following information:

• Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of your investment (a positive real
number)

• Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment
each month (a positive real number)

• Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your
investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)

• Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow

• A way to see the data (for example: “Press any key to continue…”)
It should look something like the images below, with the ability to accept input. The first image
shows what the user should see, and the second image shows the user’s values.

2. When the user continues, the console should display two static reports. One should show the
year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The
second should show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly
deposit value that was input by the user ($50.00 in this example). The following is an example of
what your interface might look like. It is in no way representative of what it must look like. Be
creative and keep the user experience in mind when designing your solution.
